# insurance-dataset-project-univariate-bivariate-and-multivariate-analysis
**Introduction** This project involves analysis of insurance dataset. The analysis involves different techniques and steps to understand the data and its patterns and to visualize the relationship between the data.

**Data analysis process involves** 

**EDA**- Exploratory data analysis involves understanding the pattern of the data and to visualization of data.

**univariate analysis**- analysis of individual variable.

**bivariate analysis**- analysis of relationship between two variables.

**multivariate analysis**- analaysis of relationship between multiple variables at once.

**group by and crosstab and pd.cut() functions** - to show the relationship between the variables and pd.cut functions                 to categories contineous data to discrete bins which transforms numerical data to categorical bins.

**relational plot**- to show scatter plot and line plot between the variables
